npm install
```

`config.js` contains the security configuration details for the simulated device. For information on where to download device certificates and details, see [AWS IoT SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js).


## Run

npm run dev
```


## Production Build

npm run build
```


## Todo
